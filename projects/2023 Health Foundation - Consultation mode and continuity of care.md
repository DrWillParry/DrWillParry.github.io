## Abstract

### Objectives

To assess whether consultation mode (either face-to-face or remote) was associated with continuity of care with a general practitioner (GP) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for a range of potential confounders at the patient and practice-level.

### Design

Observational study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) AURUM data resource, both before and during the pandemic. A cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of data in the years ending February 2020 and February 2021.

### Setting

389 primary care practices participating in CPRD AURUM in England.

### Participants

153,475 and 125,298 patients aged 2 years and over who experienced at least 3 consultations with a GP in the years ending February 2020 and February 2021, respectively. 

### Primary and secondary outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was the Usual Provider of Care (UPC) index. The secondary outcome measures were the Bice-Boxerman index and the count of consultations with the most frequently seen GP.

The analysis focuses on these outcomes calculated at the index months February 2020 and February 2021.
Each outcome is calculated using consultations with a GP during the previous 12 months.

### Results

We quantified consultation mode as the proportion of a patientâ€™s consultations with a GP over the previous 12 months that were delivered remotely. Before the pandemic, this proportion averaged 23%; during the pandemic it increased to 76%. We found little evidence consultation mode was associated with continuity at the patient level, when controlling for a range of covariates. In contrast, covariates measuring GP supply and patient demand at the practice level were consistently associated with continuity.

### Conclusions

The dramatic shift to a primarily remote model of care during the pandemic was not associated with a change in relational continuity. Improvements to GP-patient coordination alongside increases in GP availability and capacity offer a more plausible route to increasing continuity of care. 

### Strengths and limitations of this study

The study used routinely collected patient-level general practice data from a large, broadly representative pool of English primary care practices and patients participating in the CPRD AURUM data resource.

We developed a conceptual model based on the available research literature to control for potential confounders of the association between consultation mode and continuity.

We made use of data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine the effect of a sudden change in consultation mode on continuity of care.

We compared findings using three different measures of relational continuity of care and two different modelling approaches.

Identifying consultations and consultation mode in CPRD AURUM was not straightforward and required the development of a novel consultation coding system. Similarly, we were not able to measure all elements in the conceptual model.

The achieved sample sizes were smaller than specified in our protocol due to the number of consultations needed per year to measure our outcomes.

The model specifications generally avoided interactions and higher order terms to facilitate interpretation.
