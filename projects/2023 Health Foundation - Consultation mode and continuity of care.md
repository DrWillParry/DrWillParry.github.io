## Abstract

### Objectives

Investigate trends in continuity of care with a general practitioner before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identify whether continuity of care is associated with consultation mode, controlling for other patient and practice characteristics.

### Design

Retrospective, cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study, using administrative data.

### Setting

389 general practices participating in Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum in England.

### Participants

In the trend analysis, 100,000+ patients were included at each index month between April 2018 and April 2021. Modelling of the association between continuity of care and consultation mode focused on 153475 and 125298 patients in the index months of February 2020 (before the pandemic) and February 2021 (during the pandemic).

### Primary and secondary outcomes measures

The primary outcome measure was the Usual Provider of Care index. Secondary outcomes included the BiceBoxerman index and count of consultations with the most frequently seen GP.

### Results

Continuity of care was gradually declining before the pandemic but stabilised during it. There were consistent demographic, socioeconomic and regional differences in continuity of care. An average of 23% of consultations were delivered remotely in the year to February 2020 compared to 76% in February 2021. We found little evidence consultation mode was associated with continuity at the patient level, controlling for a range of covariates. In contrast, patient characteristics and practice-level supply and demand were associated with continuity.

### Conclusions

We set out to examine the association of consultation mode with continuity of care but found that GP supply and patient demand were much more important. To improve continuity for patients, primary care capacity needs to increase. This requires sufficient, long-term investment in clinicians, staff, facilities, and IT infrastructure. General practice also needs to transform ways of working to ensure continuity for those that need it, even in a capacity-constrained environment.


### Strengths and limitations of this study

* We used a large scale routinely collected patient-level data set from a nationally representative pool of English general practices.
* We developed a conceptual model identifying a variety of potential patient and practice-level factors likely to influence continuity, but unobserved confounding may still affect our results.
* We estimated the association between relational continuity of care and patient and practice-level factors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing findings from three different measures of continuity and two different modelling approaches.
* We focused on relational continuity of care with a GP only for patients with at least 3 consultations in a year and could not account for changes in management or informational continuity.
* Data quality may be an issue, as consultation mode is not consistently recorded in the data and our method for deriving consultation mode has not yet been externally validated.
