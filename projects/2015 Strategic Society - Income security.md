## Key points

- Freedom and Choice has moved UK pension policy from a mandatory to a voluntary system for annuitizing Defined Contribution (DC) pension funds.
- Overseas evidence – such as from Australia – is that voluntary annuitisation systems result in very few people using their pension savings to obtain secure, guaranteed incomes during retirement.
- Coupled with existing evidence of a ‘savings bias’ among UK pensioners and low levels of financial capability, we can forecast that average private pension incomes will gradually decline following the Freedom and Choice changes.

### Income Security and a Good Retirement

- Quantitative research looked at how level of secure income affects people’s experience of retirement among those with private pension incomes.
- Regardless of the level of someone’s financial wealth, we found that level of guaranteed income is significantly associated with various aspects of wellbeing and leisure.
- These include going to the cinema, reading a daily newspaper, taking a holiday, participation in community groups and other civic activities.
- Income is also associated with how people feel about their life, and whether they report “the conditions of my life are excellent” and “I have got the important things I want in life”.
- The research suggests that an average DC pension saver would be likely to have a better retirement if they seek to maximise their level of guaranteed income.
- If private pension incomes do decline following Freedom and Choice, this will likely lead to a reduction in levels of wellbeing among the older population.

### Our recommendations

- Actively promote receipt of a guaranteed income in pension policy to improve the wellbeing of retirees.
- Educate savers about the role of a guaranteed income in a good retirement.
- Include information about the importance of a guaranteed income for wellbeing in retirement in guidance and information from Pension Wise.
- Ensure receipt of a decent, guaranteed retirement income is the default option for DC pension savers.
- Undertake regular research into the effect of the April 2015 changes on older people’s wellbeing.
