## Summary

<a href="https://ourfuturehealth.org.uk/" target="_blank">Our Future Health</a> aims to be the UK's largest ever health research programme. It is designed to help everyone live longer and healthier lives through the discovery and testing of more effective approaches to prevention, earlier detection, and treatment of diseases.

Volunteers who sign up to take part attend an appointment at a clinic. At this appointment, they have blood samples taken and a range of point-of-care tests are conducted.

This work involved developing a range of dashboards in Microsoft Power BI to aid internal teams in planning and monitoring the roll-out of Our Future Health recruitment across the UK. The dashboards focused on the following aspects of recruitment:

* recruitment progress against targets
* diversity of volunteers compared to UK demography
* clinic location planning
* availability of clinic appointments
* rates of non-attendance and cancellation by volunteers
* rates of service cancellation by clinics
* recruitment progress via regular blood donors
