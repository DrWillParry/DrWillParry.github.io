:::{#hero-heading}

I am a British social scientist, statistician and data scientist with over 18 years' experience in research and consultancy.

I work as a freelance consultant for a variety of clients including government departments, the NHS, academia, research consultancies, think tanks, charities, the voluntary sector, and others in the UK and Europe.

I am keen on all things scientific and regard myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement#Scientific_skepticism" target="_blank">'skeptic with a k'</a>. I have previously taught statistical and survey methods, software skills for data analysis, critical thinking skills and the scientific method.
