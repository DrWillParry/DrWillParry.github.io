One issue lies with people presenting to hospital with low oxygen saturation levels, often without accompanying breathlessness (known as silent hypoxia). Delays in escalating and admitting these individuals to hospital can lead to invasive treatment, prolonged hospital stay, and an increased risk of death.\n\nRemote home monitoring models, which aim to remotely monitor COVID-19 patients at risk, have been implemented in several countries, including England, in response to COVID-19. The aim of these models is twofold:\n* avoid unnecessary hospital admissions (‘appropriate care in the appropriate place’), and\n* escalate cases of health deterioration earlier to avoid invasive ventilation and ICU admission.\n\nThe National Health Service (NHS) pilot of remote home monitoring models, which included the use of pulse oximeters that measure a person’s blood oxygen saturation levels, was launched in eight settings in England during the first wave of the pandemic. The pilots encompassed various models, with differing settings (eg primary care providing pre-hospital support or secondary care providing post-discharge support) and different mechanisms for triage and monitoring.","tags":["COVID","Public health","Quasi-experiment","Protocol","Evaluation"],"title":"Statistical analysis protocol for an evaluation of COVID Oximetry @home using a Regression Discontinuity Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rDr Will Parry Ltd. is a company limited by shares based in London, UK (registered in England and Wales under company number 09051942).

We highlight the broader health needs of these patients, and longstanding variation in use of health care by level of socioeconomic deprivation.\n* In England, almost three-quarters of people with depression and/or anxiety have at least one other physical or mental health-related long-term condition while almost a third have three or more other long-term conditions. Chronic pain is particularly prevalent among people with depression and/or anxiety (30.7% – almost double the rate seen in the general population), as are hypertension and irritable bowel syndrome.\n* People with depression and/or anxiety are more likely to have additional long-term conditions if they live in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. Among people aged 45–64 years, 72% of people with depression and/or anxiety in the least deprived areas of England had at least one additional long-term condition, compared with 86% in the most deprived areas.\n* People with depression and/or anxiety have more primary care consultations if they have additional long-term conditions, as would be expected. This group are also prescribed more medications, including more mental health-related medications. When the data are analysed by deprivation, the story becomes more complex.\n* People with depression and/or anxiety living in more deprived areas are prescribed more medications, which might suggest they have a higher level of clinical need. However, they do not receive more primary care consultations than people with depression and/or anxiety in less deprived areas, despite their potentially higher level of need.\n* Unplanned secondary health care use (A\u0026E visits and emergency hospital admissions) is higher for people with depression and/or anxiety living in more deprived areas, yet planned secondary health care use (elective hospital admissions and outpatient appointments) is not higher. This suggests that, despite their complex needs, people in the most deprived areas are not receiving as good care as those in the least deprived areas. It is unclear whether this is due to problems with the availability or suitability of services in more deprived areas, or differences in treatment-seeking behaviours.\n* People with depression and/or anxiety use secondary health care for mental health needs relatively rarely. Nevertheless, we found evidence that they are more likely to use unplanned secondary health care relating to mental health if they live in more deprived areas. We do not see this pattern with deprivation for planned secondary mental health care use.\n* Further research is needed into the inequalities highlighted by this analysis. These are important at any time, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has made the issues more acute. The latest estimates are that up to 10 million people in England have additional mental health needs as a direct consequence of the pandemic. Resources must be targeted appropriately, particularly to primary care services in deprived areas to help meet the needs of people with mental health conditions.","tags":["Descriptive analysis","Mental health","Long term conditions"],"title":"Inequalities in health care for people with depression and/or anxiety","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Crowe","Apteligen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"6d4c41d48d880eed67fd5a5b2b4ec6a6","permalink":"https://willparry.net/publication/crowe2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/crowe2020/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background**\n\nCrowe (formerly Crowe Horwath), in association with Apteligen, were commissioned by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) to undertake an independent review on the cost of providing quality childcare in Ireland.

This contract was awarded in Autumn 2017.\n\nThe brief included: * analysing the current costs of providing ELC and SAC and the factors that impact on these costs; * the development and delivery of a model of the unit costs of providing ELC and SAC that allows analysis of policy changes and variation in cost-drivers, including the potential impact of professionalisation; and * providing an objective, high-level market analysis of the sector in Ireland, including analysis of fee levels charged to parents.\n\nAn Oversight Group for this work was established by DCYA, comprising representatives from the DCYA, the Department of Education and Skills (DES), and Pobal. The Oversight Group met regularly to provide insight, review outputs, discuss and sign off on key project decisions, including the design of the survey tool.

[See the results of the international study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217353).*\n\nThe paper adopts a rigorous approach to assigning costs to each patient based on their recorded activity and utilisation. Other researchers may find the methods presented in this paper useful when attempting to cost a full range of health care activity. This working paper has not been peer-reviewed, however we are publishing it as we believe it contributes to the literature in this area.\n\n**Key points**\n- Despite the increasing financial pressure on the NHS over the past decades, there has been little research to understand the distribution and concentration of health care costs across the population.\n- This paper explores for the first time the distribution of both primary and secondary health care costs in England, including GP-prescribed drug cost. Identifying high-cost, high-need patients and examining the way in which they use health care services might help to design initiatives to reduce costs or to improve efficiency.\n\n\n**Summary of findings**\n- Analysis identifying the top 5% of users of primary and secondary care services by cost, using a large nationally representative sample in the year 2014/15, found that mean annual costs per patient were over 20 times higher in the top 5% of patients compared with all other patients (£9,789 vs £487).\n- The top 5% of patients accounted for around 50% of the total health care budget for primary care, secondary care and GP-prescribed drug therapy. This meant that more money was spent overall for the top 5% of patients (£147m) than all other patients (£139m).\n- Although high-cost, high-need patients (top 5%) have higher costs across all categories analysed - primary care, outpatient care, emergency care and GP-prescribed drug therapies -, spending on this group was dominated by inpatient care (£6,892 inpatient costs per high-cost, high-need patient).\n- Of the mean cost per patient for inpatient care, 9% and 8% was related to Ambulatory Care Sensitive admissions for the top 5% of patients and all other patients respectively. This suggests that initiatives to improve cost-effectiveness could focus on preventing avoidable inpatient hospital admissions, which is a key tenet of the NHS Long Term Plan.\n- The descriptive analysis indicates that the strongest drivers of being in the high-cost, high-need group are age, multimorbidity and deprivation; however, the paper does not explore the relative contribution of these factors. This suggests the need for a system-wide, long-term response to reducing socio-economic inequalities which may yield benefits to health system efficiency.\n- The design, delivery and management of high-cost, high-need patients have important implications for overall health system costs. Interventions that focus on better managing these patients in primary care and the community, reducing the need for unplanned and costly hospital admissions, could help reduce costs and improve the quality of care.","tags":["Descriptive analysis","Public health"],"title":"A descriptive analysis of health care use by highcost, high-need patients in England","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parry W","Wolters A T","Brine R J","Steventon A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554422400,"objectID":"899b8257aa5029a64e41d72dfaf54cee","permalink":"https://willparry.net/publication/parry2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parry2019/","section":"publication","summary":"**Objectives** To assess the effects of an integrated care pathway on the use of primary and secondary healthcare by patients at high risk of emergency inpatient admission. **Design** Observational study of a real-life deployment of integrated care, using patient-level administrative data.

The project aimed to reduce the number of children being removed into care and improve the health and wellbeing of the women in the programme.*\n\n**Project**\n\nPause is a voluntary programme for women who have experienced, or are at risk of, repeat removals of children from their care. It aims to reduce the number of children being removed into care by working with women who have had children removed to improve their wellbeing, resilience, and stability. Pause offers women an 18-month, individually-tailored, intensive package of support, delivered by a dedicated Practitioner, which is intended to address a broad range of emotional, psychological, practical, and behavioural needs.\n\nAs a condition of beginning this voluntary programme, women agree to use an effective form of reversible contraceptive for the 18-month duration of the programme. This is intended to allow women the opportunity to reflect and focus on their own needs. In addition to providing support, Pause works in collaboration with partner agencies (such as health and domestic violence services), at operational and strategic levels, to improve the broader service response to Pause women.\n\nPause began in Hackney in 2013, and received funding from the Department for Education Innovation Programme in 2015 to expand the pilot within Hackney, and to Doncaster, Greenwich, Hull, Islington, Newham, and Southwark. While most pilot Practices worked only with women who had had at least 2 children removed from their care, one Practice worked only with women who had had one child removed, and another – the first Pause Practice – worked with multiple (‘one child removed' and ‘2 or more children removed') cohorts.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nThis evaluation report assesses the impact of programme delivery, as well as the processes through which impact was achieved, for 125 women engaging with Pause at these 7 pilot Practices. It also offers an assessment of the fiscal costs and benefits of delivering the programme. The evaluation period ran from March 2015 to September 2016. It should be noted that, due to the timing of the evaluation period, at the first Pause Practice only the ‘1 child removed' cohort took part in the evaluation. In total, the evaluation cohort included 95 women who had had 2 or more children removed at 5 Practices, and 30 women who had had one child removed at 2 Practices.\nThe central evaluation questions were:\n- to what extent is the Pause model effective in reducing the numbers of children removed from women's care?\n- to what extent does engagement with the Pause programme have a positive impact on women's wellbeing, resilience and stability?\n- how cost-effective is the Pause programme?\n- how do individual elements of the Pause programme relate to its impact?\n- what factors enable, or hinder, the achievement of Pause's aims?","tags":["Quasi-experiment","Vulnerable women"],"title":"Evaluation of Pause","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lloyd J","Parry W"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"270987e63f5795aab68e9974fcac848f","permalink":"https://willparry.net/publication/lloyd2015/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lloyd2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This report describes the results of quantitative research into older homeowners in the UK, using data drawn from the 2011 Census and a nationally representative panel survey.\n\nIn 2011, there were around 6.5 million older living in owner-occupied homes in England, of whom 5.7 million owned their home outright, with the remainder owning with a mortgage or some form of shared ownership.\n\nPatterns of tenure in the 65+ population are broadly consistent, with 70-80% of older people living in owner-occupied homes in different geographic areas. However, within the older generation owner-occupation rates are lower among the oldest-old (85+) than those aged 65 to 74.\n\nIn 2011-12, the median value of older people’s homes in the UK was £200,000, with this average varying across different regions between £150,000 and £300,000.\n\nIn all areas of the UK, nearly three-quarters (72%) of older people living in owner-occupied homes have three or more bedrooms in their home. Around two-thirds of older people living in owner-occupied housing in the UK live with a partner, while just under one-third live alone.\n\nLevels of income among older homeowners vary significantly by area. In most regions, total gross monthly personal income at the 50th percentile (median) is around £1,000 per month (2011-12 prices). With the exception of Northern Ireland, over half of older homeowners have an employer pension. Across the East and South of England, over 20% report a private pension or annuity income. Around four-fifths of older homeowners in the UK report that they are ‘living comfortably’ or ‘doing alright’.\n\nThe incidence of longstanding illness or disability among older owners varies relatively widely across different UK regions, from 19% in the South East to 31% in the North East. The most common types of disability issues related to mobility, as well as to lifting, carrying or moving objects. Over 10% of older homeowners report providing round the clock care (100+ hours per week).\n\nAround one in ten older homeowners cite issues with noisy neighbours or pollution, although the percentage reporting problems with pollution is significantly higher in London. Most older homeowners (over four-fifths) are happy with the standard of local medical services, with no real regional variations observable. Less than 5% of older homeowners across the UK report being unable to access services when they need to.\n\nJust over half of older homeowners describe their neighbourhood as close-knit. Only 4% of older homeowners feel that people in their neighbourhood can’t be trusted, and just 3% report they do not feel they belong in their neighbourhood. Most older homeowners – typically over four-fifths – feel that they belong in their local neighbourhood. Around four-fifths report that they are similar to people in their neighbourhood.\n\nThe vast majority of older-owners (97%) report that they like their present neighbourhood, and nearly one in ten (86%) say they plan to remain in their neighbourhood for a number of years.\n\nNearly one in five (19%) of older homeowners report that they would prefer to move. However, only 4% of older homeowners – or 21% of those who prefer to move – expect to move in the next year.

Despite this, the majority of adults are not sufficiently active to benefit health.\n\nGovernment has consistently sought to increase levels of physical activity in the population (as well as develop elite sport talent) by focusing policy on the promotion of traditional, competitive sport in schools. The main rationale for this approach is that children who play lots of sport in school will continue participating as adults.\n\nThe academic literature has frequently criticised the focus on traditional, competitive sports, citing evidence that they have limited appeal to many children, exclude those with lower levels of skill and fitness, and may be counter-productive in terms of promoting lifelong activity. There is, however, scant prospective, quantitative evidence available to support either perspective.\n\nThe research presented in this thesis uses longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study, and robust statistical methods, to identify how childhood experiences of sport and exercise develop between primary and secondary school, and how they are associated with adult exercise behaviour. Hypotheses based on government policy assertions and academic theory are tested.\n\nThe findings provide little support for government policy: the cohort members’ participation in school sport was not independently associated with their exercise behaviour in adulthood. In contrast, there was consistent support for academic theory. Parental and family influences (posited by family socialisation theory) were consistently identified as key determinants of sport and exercise experiences, both in school and in adulthood. Likewise, an interest in physical fitness in childhood (i.e. intrinsic motivation, as described in self-determination theory) also affected adult exercise behaviour.\n\nThe findings are used to suggest alternative approaches by which government might encourage physical activity in the population.","tags":["Physical activity","Public health","School sport","British Cohort Study"],"title":"Do Active Children Become Active Adults?

The effect was similar for boys and girls, although boys were generally more active than girls in their spare time.\n\nIn contrast, the amount of curricular time devoted to sport and physical education did not affect how much children said they enjoyed sport, or their perceived level of ability.\n\nThe findings suggested that parental and family influences were the most influential factors in children’s participation in sport outside of school, while family social class and income levels were not found to affect children’s activity levels.\n\nSince the London 2012 games, there has been an increasing policy focus on primary school sport, with the intention of making children more active and building  a legacy of lifelong participation in sport.\n\nHowever, Will Parry, who conducted the research, warns that current government policy, which focuses on traditional sports, competition and performance, could have a negative effect on those children who are not supported by their parents to be active.\n\nHe said: 'Competitive sporting environments in primary school may impact on children’s enjoyment by emphasising performance and encouraging peer comparisons of ability. This could reduce the participation of those who are already less likely to be active outside of school.'","tags":["Path analysis","Young people","Physical activity"],"title":"Experiences of physical activity at age 10 in the 1970 British Cohort Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bonnell C","Jamal F","Harden A","Wells H","Parry W","Fletcher A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1370044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1370044800,"objectID":"d8540a8b12b206bcd004317e4787f3ac","permalink":"https://willparry.net/publication/bonnell2013a/","publishdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bonnell2013a/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background:** In contrast to curriculum-based health education interventions in schools, the school environment approach promotes health by modifying schools’ physical/social environment. This systematic review reports on the health effects of the school environment and processes by which these might occur. It includes theories, intervention outcome and process evaluations, quantitative studies and qualitative studies.\n\n**Research questions:** Research question (RQ)1: What theories are used to inform school environment interventions or explain school-level health influences? What testable hypotheses are suggested? RQ2: What are the effects on student health/inequalities of school environment interventions addressing organisation/management; teaching/pastoral care/discipline; and the physical environment? What are the costs? RQ3: How feasible/acceptable and context dependent are such interventions? RQ4: What are the effects on student health/inequalities of school-level measures of organisation/management; teaching/pastoral care/discipline; and the physical environment? RQ5: Through what processes might such influences occur?\n\n**Data sources:** A total of 16 databases were searched between 30 July 2010 and 23 September 2010 to identify relevant studies, including the British Educational Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Health Management Information Consortium, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. In addition, references of included studies were checked and authors contacted.\n\n**Review methods:** In stage 1, we mapped references concerning how the school environment affects health and consulted stakeholders to identify stage 2 priorities. In stage 2, we undertook five reviews corresponding to our RQs.\n\n**Results:** Stage 1: A total of 82,775 references were retrieved and 1144 were descriptively mapped. Stage 2: A total of 24 theories were identified (RQ1). The human functioning and school organisation, social capital and social development theories were judged most useful. Ten outcome evaluations were included (RQ2). Four US randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one UK quasi-experimental study examined interventions building school community/relationships. Studies reported benefits for some, but not all outcomes (e.g. aggression, conflict resolution, emotional health). Two US RCTs assessed interventions empowering students to contribute to modifying food/physical activity environments, reporting benefits for physical activity but not for diet. Three UK quasi-experimental evaluations examined playground improvements, reporting mixed findings, with benefits being greater for younger children and longer break times. Six process evaluations (RQ3) reported positively. One study suggested that implementation was facilitated when this built on existing ethos and when senior staff were supportive. We reviewed 42 multilevel studies, confining narrative synthesis to 10 that appropriately adjusted for confounders. Four UK/US reports suggested that schools with higher value-added attainment/attendance had lower rates of substance use and fighting. Three reports from different countries examined school policies on smoking/alcohol, with mixed results. One US study found that schools with more unobservable/unsupervised places reported increased substance use. Another US study reported that school size, age structure and staffing ratio did not correlate with student drinking. Twenty-one qualitative reports from different countries (RQ5) suggested that disengagement, lack of safety and lack of participation in decisions may predispose students to engage in health risks.\n\n**Limitations:** We found no evidence regarding health inequalities or cost, and could not undertake meta-analysis.\n\n**Conclusions:** There is non-definitive evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of school environment interventions involving community/relationship building, empowering student participation in modifying schools’ food/physical activity environments, and playground improvements. Multilevel studies suggest that schools that add value educationally may promote student health. Qualitative studies suggest pathways underlying these effects. This evidence lends broad support to theories of social development, social capital and human functioning and school organisation. Further trials to examine the effects of school environment modifications on student health are recommended.\n\n**Funding:** The National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research programme.","tags":["Systematic review","Young people","Schools and health"],"title":"Systematic review of the effects of schools and school environment interventions on health: evidence mapping and synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parry W"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1364774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1364774400,"objectID":"5f64ae9808872395d6a82d02a6f8bdb4","permalink":"https://willparry.net/publication/parry2013a/","publishdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parry2013a/","section":"publication","summary":"This short paper was written in response to a consultation by the government on the legacy of the 2012 London Olympic Games. It made the following main points:\n1. Policy has implicitly made traditional elite sport the model for school provision\n2. A focus on competition is detrimental to the majority of children's enjoyment and maintenance of sport at and beyond school\n3. The population's preferences could be used as a model for provision\n\nThe concluding paragraph is reproduced below:\n\n*For too long schools have been viewed as training grounds for the elite athletes of the future, essentially making use of a large captive population to filter out those who might be able to achieve gold medals for the country. This focus biases policy toward perverse approaches to getting children to be more active, focusing on competition and performance, as opposed to fun, variety and inclusivity. Being physically active is not the same as taking part in competitive sport. There are many ways to be active. The type of activity and whether it is participated in competitively have no bearing on whether one is reaching healthy levels of activity. Focusing on these things simply serves to reduce choice, opportunity and enjoyment.*","tags":["Physical activity","Education","Sport"],"title":"Education Committee: Written Evidence Submitted by Will Parry, Department of Quantitative Social Science, Institute of Education, University of London","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bonnell C","Parry W","Wells H","Jamal F","Fletcher A","Harden A","Thomas J","Campbell R","Petticrew M","Murphy S","Whitehead M","Moore L"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b62a2af49f53c15ec0a7ed53df62431b","permalink":"https://willparry.net/publication/bonnell2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bonnell2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Health outcomes vary between schools and it is theorised that this may be partly attributable to variation in the school environment.

Each pilot has a different service delivery model; however, all are based on the idea that an effective response to chaos and entrenched deprivation is a consistent, trusted adult who can advocate between local services and service users.\n\n**Main findings and implications**\n\nThe main findings of this report are:\n* The client group comprised some of the most chaotic or isolated individuals in a local community, who were hard to reach and difficult to engage. The success of the programme should be interpreted in this light.\n* The work of the pilots was not expensive. Most of the expense was attributable to members of staff working one-to-one with clients or in group work.\n* The pilot workers often worked as consistent, trusted adults. They worked effectively with the most chaotic and isolated adults to help them navigate the local services and move between transition points in their lives. The pilots were effective in bringing about better outcomes for the individuals, particularly in terms of health.\n* The consistency of the pilot workers was beneficial to persuading local services to engage with the client group, even in circumstances where clients had been previously denied or not engaged. The pilots were effective at bringing about changes in local service delivery by ensuring that services were open to all.\n* Although the work of the pilots saw an increase in expenditure on these adults, expenditure was on beneficial services that were good for the clients – health and accommodation – or those that helped to stabilise the client, such as benefits.\n* It is reasonable to assume that the effectiveness of the pilots will become more obvious as they work with clients over a longer period of time.\n\nThese findings demonstrate implications for the pilots, local commissioners and policy makers (see change below) in central and local government. The implications for each are described below.\n\nPilots need to ensure that their services fit with local priorities and commissioning strategy and that they demonstrate the value of the consistent, trusted adult.\n\nLocal commissioners need to recognise that Adults facing Chronic Exclusion clients are entitled to services and benefits and that by allowing these clients to work with consistent, trusted adults, their staff are better supported to provide the service to this difficult group and allow them to access services appropriately.\n\nFor policy makers, while there is little evidence that costs are shifting from centrally-funded emergency services to locally-funded health services, it is apparent that these services are being used more appropriately. The Adults facing Chronic Exclusion programmes have demonstrated the value of the consistent, trusted adult that can be applied to move individuals to employment and improved accommodation.","tags":["Multiple deprivation","Social exclusion","Evaluation","Pilot programme"],"title":"Simple but effective: Local solutions for adults facing multiple deprivation (Adults facing Chronic Exclusion evaluation)","type":"publication"}]
