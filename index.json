One issue lies with people presenting to hospital with low oxygen saturation levels, often without accompanying breathlessness (known as silent hypoxia). Delays in escalating and admitting these individuals to hospital can lead to invasive treatment, prolonged hospital stay, and an increased risk of death.\n\nRemote home monitoring models, which aim to remotely monitor COVID-19 patients at risk, have been implemented in several countries, including England, in response to COVID-19. The aim of these models is twofold:\n* avoid unnecessary hospital admissions (‘appropriate care in the appropriate place’), and\n* escalate cases of health deterioration earlier to avoid invasive ventilation and ICU admission.\n\nThe National Health Service (NHS) pilot of remote home monitoring models, which included the use of pulse oximeters that measure a person’s blood oxygen saturation levels, was launched in eight settings in England during the first wave of the pandemic. The pilots encompassed various models, with differing settings (eg primary care providing pre-hospital support or secondary care providing post-discharge support) and different mechanisms for triage and monitoring.","tags":["COVID","Public health","Quasi-experiment","Protocol","Evaluation"],"title":"Statistical analysis protocol for an evaluation of COVID Oximetry @home using a Regression Discontinuity Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rDr Will Parry Ltd. is a company limited by shares based in London, UK (registered in England and Wales under company number 09051942).

[See the results of the international study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217353).*\n\nThe paper adopts a rigorous approach to assigning costs to each patient based on their recorded activity and utilisation. Other researchers may find the methods presented in this paper useful when attempting to cost a full range of health care activity. This working paper has not been peer-reviewed, however we are publishing it as we believe it contributes to the literature in this area.\n\n**Key points** Despite the increasing financial pressure on the NHS over the past decades, there has been little research to understand the distribution and concentration of health care costs across the population. This paper explores for the first time the distribution of both primary and secondary health care costs in England, including GP-prescribed drug cost. Identifying high-cost, high-need patients and examining the way in which they use health care services might help to design initiatives to reduce costs or to improve efficiency.\n\n**Summary of findings** Analysis identifying the top 5% of users of primary and secondary care services by cost, using a large nationally representative sample in the year 2014/15, found that mean annual costs per patient were over 20 times higher in the top 5% of patients compared with all other patients (£9,789 vs £487).\n\nThe top 5% of patients accounted for around 50% of the total health care budget for primary care, secondary care and GP-prescribed drug therapy. This meant that more money was spent overall for the top 5% of patients (£147m) than all other patients (£139m).\nAlthough high-cost, high-need patients (top 5%) have higher costs across all categories analysed - primary care, outpatient care, emergency care and GP-prescribed drug therapies -, spending on this group was dominated by inpatient care (£6,892 inpatient costs per high-cost, high-need patient).\n\nOf the mean cost per patient for inpatient care, 9% and 8% was related to Ambulatory Care Sensitive admissions for the top 5% of patients and all other patients respectively. This suggests that initiatives to improve cost-effectiveness could focus on preventing avoidable inpatient hospital admissions, which is a key tenet of the NHS Long Term Plan.\n\nThe descriptive analysis indicates that the strongest drivers of being in the high-cost, high-need group are age, multimorbidity and deprivation; however, the paper does not explore the relative contribution of these factors. This suggests the need for a system-wide, long-term response to reducing socio-economic inequalities which may yield benefits to health system efficiency.\n\nThe design, delivery and management of high-cost, high-need patients have important implications for overall health system costs. Interventions that focus on better managing these patients in primary care and the community, reducing the need for unplanned and costly hospital admissions, could help reduce costs and improve the quality of care.","tags":["Descriptive analysis","Public health"],"title":"A descriptive analysis of health care use by high cost, high need patients in England","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569196800,"objectID":"cdc826878b23f0feda449f5b325f1517","permalink":"/code/thf_high_cost_users/","publishdate":"2019-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/code/thf_high_cost_users/","section":"code","summary":"","tags":["SAS code","Open source"],"title":"A descriptive analysis of health care use by high cost patients in England","type":"code"},{"authors":["Parry W","Wolters A T","Brine R J","Steventon A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554422400,"objectID":"899b8257aa5029a64e41d72dfaf54cee","permalink":"/publication/parry2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parry2019/","section":"publication","summary":"**Objectives** To assess the effects of an integrated care pathway on the use of primary and secondary healthcare by patients at high risk of emergency inpatient admission. **Design** Observational study of a real-life deployment of integrated care, using patient-level administrative data. Regression analysis was used to compare integrated care patients with matched controls. **Setting** A deprived, inner city London borough (Tower Hamlets). **Participants** 1,720 patients aged 50+ years registered with a general practitioner in Tower Hamlets and at high risk of emergency inpatient admission enrolled onto integrated care during 2014. These patients were matched to control patients, also selected from Tower Hamlets, with respect to demographics, diagnoses of health conditions, previous hospital use and risk score. **Interventions** Enrolled patients were eligible for a range of interventions, such as case management, support with self-care and enhanced care coordination. Control patients received usual care. **Primary and secondary endpoints** Number of emergency inpatient admissions in the year after enrolment onto integrated care. Secondary endpoints included numbers of elective inpatient admissions, inpatient bed days, accident and emergency attendances, outpatient attendances and general practitioner contacts in the year after enrolment. **Results** There was no evidence that the integrated care pathway reduced patients’ healthcare utilisation in the first year post-enrolment. Matched controls and integrated care patients were similar at baseline. Following enrolment, integrated care patients were more likely than matched controls to experience elective inpatient admissions (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.27, 95%CI 1.08 to 1.49, p=0.004).

Despite this, the majority of adults are not sufficiently active to benefit health.\n\nGovernment has consistently sought to increase levels of physical activity in the population (as well as develop elite sport talent) by focusing policy on the promotion of traditional, competitive sport in schools. The main rationale for this approach is that children who play lots of sport in school will continue participating as adults.\n\nThe academic literature has frequently criticised the focus on traditional, competitive sports, citing evidence that they have limited appeal to many children, exclude those with lower levels of skill and fitness, and may be counter-productive in terms of promoting lifelong activity. There is, however, scant prospective, quantitative evidence available to support either perspective.\n\nThe research presented in this thesis uses longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study, and robust statistical methods, to identify how childhood experiences of sport and exercise develop between primary and secondary school, and how they are associated with adult exercise behaviour. Hypotheses based on government policy assertions and academic theory are tested.\n\nThe findings provide little support for government policy: the cohort members’ participation in school sport was not independently associated with their exercise behaviour in adulthood. In contrast, there was consistent support for academic theory. Parental and family influences (posited by family socialisation theory) were consistently identified as key determinants of sport and exercise experiences, both in school and in adulthood. Likewise, an interest in physical fitness in childhood (i.e. intrinsic motivation, as described in self-determination theory) also affected adult exercise behaviour.\n\nThe findings are used to suggest alternative approaches by which government might encourage physical activity in the population.","tags":["Physical activity","Public health","School sport","British Cohort Study"],"title":"Do Active Children Become Active Adults?
